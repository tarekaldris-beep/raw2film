# Raw2Film

### Changes in the fork
- Double clicking the scrolling button returns the value to the default value.
- Value can be now manually typed for fine adjustments (not only using the scrolling function)
- Halation now does not blur the whole photo but only affect the highlights.
- added the effect "Bloom" that mimics Diffusion filters.

Raw2Film is full raw image editor with a focus on realistic film emulation.

The looks are based on published film datasheets and use the image processing pipeline
from [Spectral Film LUT](https://github.com/JanLohse/spectral_film_lut).

The film emulation includes:

- Both negative and print material emulation for a huge variety of emulsions.
- Grain with varying intensity based on brightness and hue.
- Halation to add natural glow to highlights (no data available, so intensity should be
  adjusted to taste).
- Resolution and micro-contrast matches mtf chart for each film stock.
- Set the simulated frame size to match resolution, grain intensity, and aspect ratio.

## Installation

To run Raw2Film it is required to have installed [exiftool](https://exiftool.org/) on
your system.
On Linux this can be done easily with

```bash
sudo apt install exiftool
```

### Windows
Download the latest `.exe` from the [releases](../../releases) page and run it. (If ExifTool is not
found despite being installed and put on `PATH`, try placing the `.exe` of Raw2Film and
ExifTool in the same folder.)

Alternatively, install via Python (see [below](#python-package)).

### Linux
Download the `.AppImage` from the [releases](../../releases) page and make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x raw2film-{version}.AppImage
./raw2film-{version}.AppImage
```

Alternatively, install via Python (see [below](#python-package)).

### macOS
There is currently no native binary available for macOS.
Install and run the application using a Python-based method.
See the [Python Package](#python-package) section below.

### Python Package

Install the application using your preferred Python package manager. We show it for the
default pip. Others can be found in the full documentation.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/JanLohse/raw2film
```

Then just run with:

```bash
raw2film
```

## Usage

The interface is designed to be familiar for anyone who has used a raw editor before.

- The image bar on the bottom lets you select one or multiple images to edit at once. (
  Select multiple with Shift or Ctrl.)
- Copy settings from one image to the selected ones by clicking on the thumbnail with
  the middle mouse button.
- Double click on a settings label to reset to the default value.
- Many shortcuts are available. Hover over a setting to see its description and
  shortcut.
- By default a simplified render is activated for preview to make the software more
  responsive. Activate the full preview under view to see the full film characterisitcs.

### Filmstock Selector


When clicking on the magnifying glass a window opens to search and browse through the
available film stocks.
